## Relational Database Concepts

### Database

- Database is a collection of related data
- Long term storage: data is persisted and can be retrieved later
- Typically, a database contains also metadata
- Descriptions of data types, structures, and constraints of the actual data
- Compare to plain files
- **Database Management System** (DBMS) is collection of applications that can be used to create and maintain databases
  - MySQL, SQLite, Microsoft SQL Server, etc.
- Note: several applications or users can use the same database

### Database model

- A **Database model** defines
  - Structure of a database
  - How data is stored, organized, and manipulated
- Different database models
  - Relational model
  - Network model
  - Object model
  - Document model
- **Relational model** is the most widely used database model
  - Implemented by several DBMSes (e.g. MySQL, Postgre, Oracle, etc.) since 1970s
  - Relational databases are typically operated through **Structured Query Language (SQL)**

### Relational database model

- Data is stored in named tables
- A table is a collection of records (rows) that have similar properties (columns)
- Each table has a dedicated column (primary key, PK) that identifies its records unambiguously
- Each table may have a column (foreign key, FK) that is used to reference primary key in another table
- Note:
  - Columns have no specific order
  - Records have no specific order
- Designing a database comprises of defining and identifying tables, columns, and keys we need
- After a database has been designed and implemented, the actual data (records) may be inserted (or imported) into it
- An operational database may be queried for information (search and
combine information stored in records)

#### MediaItems table example data

| media_id (PK) | filename | filesize | title     | description | user_id (FK) | media_type | created_at           |
|----------|----------|----------|----------------|-------------|---------|------------|---------------------------|
| 9632     | ffd8.jpg | 887574   | Favorite drink |             | 305     | image/jpeg | 2023-10-16T19:00:09.000Z  |
| 9626     | dbbd.jpg | 60703    | Miika          | My Photo    | 305     | image/jpeg | 2023-10-13T12:14:26.000Z  |
| 9625     | 2f9b.jpg | 30635    | Aksux and Jane | friends     | 260     | image/jpeg | 2023-10-12T20:03:08.000Z  |

#### User table example data

| user_id (PK) | username  | password   | email        | user_level_id | created_at                |
|---------|-----------|------------|-------------------|---------------|---------------------------|
| 260     | VCHar     | secret123  | vchar@example.com | 1             | 2020-09-12T06:56:41.000Z  |
| 305     | Donatello | secret234  | dona@example.com  | 1             | 2021-12-11T06:00:41.000Z  |
| 3609    | Anon5468  | secret345  | x58df@example.com | 3             | 2023-04-02T05:56:41.000Z  |

**What is the relation between these two tables?**

### Primary key (PK)

- A column (or group of colums) that uniquely identifies records (rows) in the table
- Must be unique value, two records cannot have the same value for the primary key
- Each record must have a value for primary key
- Every table must have a primary key (defined by database designer)
- Sometimes it is difficult to identify proper, unique primary identifier among columns
  - in these cases, a surrogate key (e.g "id") may be added
  - surrogate key is typically a sequential number (e.g., an auto-incremented number in SQL databases) that is assigned to each record as it is created

### Foreign key (FK)

- Foreign key references primary key in another table
  - creates a relation between tables
  - Reference may be missing (NULL value)

Table Users {
  user_id INT PK
  username VARCHAR
  password VARCHAR
  email VARCHAR
  user_level_id INT FK
  created_at TIMESTAMP
}

Table MediaItems {
  media_id INT PK
  user_id INT FK
  filename VARCHAR
  filesize INT
  media_type VARCHAR
  title VARCHAR
  description VARCHAR
  created_at TIMESTAMP
}

Users ||--o{ MediaItems : owns

```

### Integrity constraints

- Integrity constraints are **rules that database records must satisfy**
  - Otherwise database might end up in inconsistent or unusable state
  - Constraints are (usually) enforced by DBMS at all times
- **Primary key constrain**: Primary key values must be unique
- **Referential Integrity Constraint**: Referenced primary key value must exist (enforcement varies between DBMSes)
- **Value constraint**: Each column has a data type defined; values must be within the range

### Database server and client

- **Database server** is a computer that runs database system
  - You need an account to use the system
- **Database client** is a program that connects to server and requests database services
  - Client may have just a command line or graphical user interface
  - In this course the client will be a back-end web application
- Typically client and server reside on different machines, but may also run in the same machine
  - E.g. the development environment setup on your laptop

### Terminology in Finnish

- Database: tietokanta
- Table: taulu
- Record: tietue
- Column (field): sarake (kenttä)
- Primary Key: perusavain/pääavain
- Foreign Key: viiteavain
- Integrity Constraint: eheysrajoite
- DBMS: tietokannanhallintajärjestelmä
- Key Constraint: avainrajoite
- Referential Integrity Constraint: viite-eheysrajoite
- Value Constraint: arvoaluerajoite

## Structured Query Language, SQL

- Standardized language for operating relational databases
  - Supported by many DBMSes – MariaDB, MySQL, SQLite, PostgreSQL, Oracle, etc.
  - Minor differences between implementations
- Operations for:
  - Database creation
  - Data insertion, deletion, and updates
  - Querying database
- Declarative query language: user describes what data he wants to find, and DBMS figures out a way to get it

### Creating a database

```sql
-- Remove existing database completely (needs a root access to DBMS)
DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS database_name;
-- Create a new database (needs a root access to DBMS)
CREATE DATABASE database_name;
-- Connect to the database
USE database_name;

-- Example

DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS mediashare;
CREATE DATABASE mediashare;
USE mediashare;
```

Notes:

- SQL statements end with semicolon and may be split into several lines
- SQL statements can be a written in a script (plain text) file and run from there
- SQL is not case sensitive, but it is a good practice to write SQL keywords in uppercase
- Use `show databases` command to show available databases
- `DROP DATABASE database_name;` deletes the database and all its tables and data completely (No comfirmation is asked!)

### Creating tables

```sql
CREATE TABLE table_name (
  column_name1 data_type [NOT NULL] [UNIQUE] [PRIMARY KEY],
  column_name2 data_type [NOT NULL] [UNIQUE],
  column_name3 data_type [NOT NULL] [UNIQUE],
  ...
  column_nameN data_type [NOT NULL] [UNIQUE],
  PRIMARY KEY (column_name1)
);
```

- `create table` statement creates a new database table (just the table structure, not any records)
- The statement defines:
  - Table name
  - Column names and data types
  - Primay key column(s)
  - Possibly foreign keys as well (enforcement of foreign key constraint depends on the database engine and settings)
  - Other constraints, e.g. NOT NULL if column value cannot be NULL, UNIQUE if column values must be unique, AUTO_INCREMENT if column value is automatically incremented when new record is inserted
- Tips:
  - `show tables` lists all existing tables
  - `describe table_name` describes details of given table
  - `drop table_name` deletes given table completely
  - `alter table` may be used to modify existing table
  - Creating tables is often a bit tedious, so it’s best to store the statements in a script file

Example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Users (
  user_id INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
  username VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  user_level_id INT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE MediaItems (
  media_id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  user_id INT NOT NULL,
  filename VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  filesize INT NOT NULL,
  media_type VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  description VARCHAR(255),
  created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (media_id),
  FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES Users(user_id)
);
```

- Column data types define what kind of data is stored in the column
- There are plenty of different data types, see e.g. <https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_datatypes.asp>
- The most data types are:
  - INT - Integer values
  - DOUBLE - Floating point numbers
  - VARCHAR - Strings
  - DATE - Dates
  - TIMESTAMP/DATETIME - Date and time
- Foreign key specifications are not mandatory, but necessary if one wants to enforce foreign key constraint (Referenced tables should be created first)

### Inserting data

```sql
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3, ...)
  VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);

-- or

INSERT INTO table_name
  VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);
```

- `insert into` statement inserts records into existing table
  - First version specifies values to given columns, the latter version requires
values for all the columns
- You can list all existing records with `select * from table_name;`

Examples:

```sql
INSERT INTO Users VALUES (260, 'VCHar', 'secret123', 'vchar@example.com', 1, null);
INSERT INTO Users VALUES (305, 'Donatello', 'secret234', 'dona@example.com', 1, null);

-- FK constraint fails, user_id 1606 does not exist
INSERT INTO MediaItems (filename, filesize, title, description, user_id, media_type) 
  VALUES ('ffd8.jpg', 887574, 'Favorite drink', '', 1606, 'image/jpeg');

-- Inserting multiple records at once
INSERT INTO MediaItems (filename, filesize, title, description, user_id, media_type) 
  VALUES ('ffd8.jpg', 887574, 'Favorite drink', null, 305, 'image/jpeg'),
         ('dbbd.jpg', 60703, 'Miika', 'My Photo', 305, 'image/jpeg'),
         ('2f9b.jpg', 30635, 'Aksux and Jane', 'friends', 260, 'image/jpeg');

```

Note: referenced records (`user_id` in this case) in other tables must exist (foreign key constraint)
There are other ways and tools for mass importing data, e.g. from CSV files, other databases, etc.

### Querying data

- SQL queries retrieve meaningful data from a database
- SQL is a declarative language
  - Tell what kind of data you’re interested in
  - DBMS figures out a way to get the data for you

Select statement:

```sql
SELECT [ALL | DISTINCT] column1[,column2]
  FROM table1[,table2]
  [WHERE conditions]
  [GROUP BY column-list]
  [HAVING conditions]
  [ORDER BY column-list [ASC | DESC] ]
  [LIMIT number];
```

- `select` - selects desired column(s) `*` means every column
- `from` which table(s) the data is retrieved from
- `where` - Conditions that records must satisfy (optional)
- `group by` - Group records by given column(s) (optional)
- `having` - Conditions that groups must satisfy (optional)
- `order by` - Order records by given column(s) in ASCending or DESCending order (optional)
- `limit` - Limit the number of records (optional)

```sql
-- Select all columns from the MediaItems table:
SELECT * FROM MediaItems;

-- Select all media items for a specific user:
SELECT * FROM MediaItems WHERE user_id = 260;

-- Select usernames and emails from the Users table:
SELECT username, email FROM Users;

-- Select the top 5 largest media items
SELECT * FROM MediaItems ORDER BY filesize DESC LIMIT 2;
```

#### Operators and functions

- Arithmetic operators: + - * / %
- Equal to: `=` example: `firstname = 'Eric’`
- Not equal to: `<>` example: `firstname <> 'Mike’`
- Greater than: `>` example: `dateofbirth > '1993-01-31’`
- Less than: `<` example: `salary < 2000`
- Greater (Lesser) than or equal: `>=` (or `<=`) example: `salary >= 2000`
- Match a character pattern: `LIKE` example: `firstname LIKE 'Mi%'`
- Between an inclusive range: `BETWEEN` example: `salary BETWEEN 1000 AND 2000`
- Equal to one of multiple possible values: `IN` example: `deptcode IN (101, 103, 209)`
- Compare to null (missing data): `IS` or `IS NOT` example: `address IS NULL`
- Absolute value: `ABS(x)`
- Sign (-1, 0, -1): `SIGN(x)`
- Modulo: `MOD(x)`
- Raise x to power y: `POWER(x, y)`
- Square root: `SQRT(x)`
- Largest integer <= x: `FLOOR(x)`
- Smallest integer >= x: `CEIL(x)`
- Round to nearest integer: `ROUND(x)`
- Round x to d decimal places: `ROUND(x, d)`

Examples:

```sql
-- Find users with a username starting with 'D':
SELECT * FROM Users WHERE username LIKE 'D%';

-- Select users created after a certain date:
SELECT * FROM Users WHERE created_at > '2023-01-01';
```

#### Querying several tables

- Queries often need to collect data from two (or more) tables
- If one specifies two tables in `from`-clause, the result will include
every combination of records from both tables called "cartesian product". For example, if the tables have 1000 records both, the result will have 1000 x 1000 = 1M rows
- Typically, one needs to specify which records from both sides are to be combined (very often through foreign keys) by using `WHERE` condition or `JOIN` operation

Examples:

```sql
-- "cartesian product" of two tables:
SELECT * FROM Users, MediaItems;

-- Select all columns from both tables where user_id matches:
SELECT * FROM Users, MediaItems WHERE Users.user_id = MediaItems.user_id;

-- Select all media items along with the username of the owner using a (inner) join:
SELECT MediaItems.*, Users.username 
  FROM MediaItems 
  JOIN Users ON MediaItems.user_id = Users.user_id;

-- Select media items with the highest filesize for each user using a subquery:
SELECT * FROM MediaItems AS MI1
WHERE filesize = (
  SELECT MAX(filesize) FROM MediaItems AS MI2
  WHERE MI1.user_id = MI2.user_id
);

-- Select all media items and all users whether they have media items or not. 
SELECT 
  Users.user_id, 
  Users.username, 
  MediaItems.media_id, 
  MediaItems.title, 
  MediaItems.filename
FROM 
  Users
LEFT OUTER JOIN MediaItems 
  ON Users.user_id = MediaItems.user_id;
```

### Updating data

Database state is changed by following operations:

- Inserting records
- Updating records
- Deleting records

- Database content updates are very common
- Database structure (tables, keys, types, etc.) should change very seldom if at all (after the design time)
  - Changes in the structure would often break applications that use the database

#### Update statement

```sql
UPDATE table_name
  SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
  WHERE condition;
```

`UPDATE` changes column values for record(s)

- If `WHERE` is missing, all records in the table are changed, Be careful!
- It is possible to specify modified records in a subquery

Examples:

```sql
UPDATE Users SET user_level_id = 2 WHERE user_id = 260;

UPDATE MediaItems SET title = 'New title' WHERE media_id = 9632;
```

#### Delete statement

```sql
DELETE FROM table_name
  WHERE condition;
```

`DELETE` removes records from a database

- If WHERE is missing, all records are removed (table is emptied). Be careful, no questions asked!

Examples:

```sql
DELETE FROM MediaItems WHERE media_id = 9632;
```

### SQL scripts

- Separate text files that contain SQL statements
  - Can be executed as necessary on the sql command line: `source path-to-script.sql`
  - using the mysql command line tool: `mysql -u username -p database_name < path-to-script.sql`
  - or in a graphical DBMS tool (Many graphical DBMS tools (e.g. MySQL Workbench) actually generate SQL scripts for its operations)
- Recommended way for database creation and data import
- Databases and their contents can be easily exported and imported as SQL scripts
  - export using a command line tool: `mysqldump -u username -p database_name > path-to-script.sql`
  - Used for backups, copying and moving databases, etc.
